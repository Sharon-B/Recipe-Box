# User Experience (UX) 

# Strategy

## Developer Objectives

To grow my skills as a developer and create a simple easy to use site. Develop the project from its initial concept to the final finished product. To demonstrate my skills of Python and MongoDb, using CRUD functionality so users can create, read, update and delete information from a database. In order to do so I will create a site that allows users to add, share, keep  & update their favourite recipes online. The project will further my knowledge of Python, the Flask framework, Jinja templating language, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB and their implementation.

### Target Audience:

* Home cooks
* People looking for inspiration and meal ideas
* General public

#### Typography:

PlayFair Display is used for the logo and headings throughout the site. It is well suited for titling. 

Roboto is used for all other text content. It’s forms are largely geometric but also features friendly and open curves, which makes for a more natural reading rhythm.

# Implementation 

Once the initial concept for the project was decided upon I first developed the wireframes and site map. From these wireframes I then developed the basic database structure required. I created 3 collections for the database, a users collection, a recipes collection & a categories collection. The database schema can be seen [here]((https://github.com/Sharon-B/Recipe-Box/blob/master/readme-documentation/initial-db-schema.png)).

I then set up the Flask app, created the environment variables needed to run the app, created requirements.txt for all dependencies used and set up a Procfile. I connected the app to MongoDB and tested it by rendering a a basic test recipe document from the recipes collection in html. The project was deployed to Heroku which I set to automatic deployment so that anytime I push code to GitHub it is able to automatically get the latest code and build the app.

Now that the infrastructure of the app was set up I could start to build the app, first I set up a base.html from which all my html templates would be extended from. As I added a route & view function in app.py I created the associated html template, also utilising Jinja templating language to insert the data into the html pages.

# Deployment

This website was created in the Gitpod development environment. After creating a new repository in GitHub using the Code Institute template, the green Gitpod button was used to initialise the repository in Gitpod. Throughout the process the git commands `git add` and `git commit` were used to store the work in the local Gitpod environment, `git push` would then be used to push the commits to the GitHub repository. From here the website could then deployed via Heroku.

## Heroku Deployment:

Before creating the application in Heroku, 

1. Create a requirements.txt file in your work environment by running the following command in the command line interface:
	`pip3 freeze —local > requirements.txt`
This will save all the dependencies currently used by the app to the requirements.txt file.

2. Create a Procfile, which tells Heroku which file runs the app and how to run it. To do this run the following command in the CLI:
	`echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

3. `Git add`, `git commit` and `git push` these files to GitHub so they are available to Heroku which will use them to build the app.

## In Heroku:

1. Login and click New -> Create New App
	- Add a name
	- Select region
	- Click Create App

2. Select Connect to GitHub, when the Github profile is displayed add the name of your repo and click search, once it finds & displays the correct repo click connect.

3. Set up the config vars required to run the app. In the Settings Tab click Revel Config Vars
- Create the following variables and assign their values:
            IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME
- Click Hide Config Vars

4. In the Deploy Tab
	- Click Enable Automatic Deploys
	- Select the branch the repo is using
	- Click Deploy Branch
 => Your app was successfully deployed will be displayed with the option to view the app.

## Creating A Local Clone:
You can clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer.

From the Git Hub repository:
- Click `Code` at the top of the file list
- Click the clipboard icon to copy the url provided

Open terminal:
- Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be
- Type `git clone` and paste the copied url after it
- Press enter and the clone will be created
