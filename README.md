## Developer Objectives

To grow my skills as a developer and create a simple easy to use site. Develop the project from its initial concept to the final finished product. To demonstrate my skills of Python and MongoDb, using CRUD functionality so users can create, read, update and delete information from a database. In order to do so I will create a site that allows users to add, share, keep  & update their favourite recipes online. The project will further my knowledge of Python, the Flask framework, Jinja templating language, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB and their implementation.

### Target Audience:

* Home cooks
* People looking for inspiration and meal ideas
* General public

# Implementation 

Once the initial concept for the project was decided upon I first developed the wireframes. 



Initially I set up the MongoDB database, Flask and Heroku deployment.......Once these were all connected and working...

base.html layout and utilised the Jinja templating language to generate html templates for each page, from which I could start coding the python code required to render the templates first and then add on more functionality to each route/view as needed. 

Throughout the project I used python interpreter to monitor what was happening in the code by using print statements in the interpreter. 



## Issues/Solutions
		
White space

edit_user() add $set to update specific fields only as initially was overwriting the whole document in the database.

## Known Bugs

Bugs found and not fixed:

# Deployment

This website was created in the Gitpod development environment. After installing the Gitpod extension for Chrome web browser and creating a new repository in GitHub using the Code Institute template, the green Gitpod button was used to initialise the repository in Gitpod. Throughout the process the git commands `git add` and `git commit` were used to store the work in the local Gitpod environment, `git push` would then be used to push the commits to the GitHub repository. From here the website could then deployed via Heroku.

## Heroku Deployment:



## Creating A Local Clone:
You can clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer.

From the Git Hub repository:
- Click `Code` at the top of the file list
- Click the clipboard icon to copy the url provided

Open terminal:
- Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be
- Type `git clone` and paste the copied url after it
- Press enter and the clone will be created
